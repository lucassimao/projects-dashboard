# Projects Dashboard

This tool helps the management of projects. You can view, edit and delete existing projects and create new ones.
The backend is a simple JSON file accessed through a REST API interface dynamically created by the [Json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx). Nx is an open source toolkit for enterprise Angular applications.

## Running end-to-end tests
